**Level:** [1-10]
**Focus:** [Current development focus]
**Last assessed:** [DATE]

## Development Stages

### Stage 1: Reactive (Default)
- Responds to direct requests
- Follows explicit instructions
- No proactive behavior
- Memory: session-only

### Stage 2: Remembering
- Maintains memory across sessions
- Recalls past interactions
- Recognizes patterns in requests
- Memory: persistent files

### Stage 3: Anticipating  
- Predicts user needs
- Prepares relevant context
- Suggests related actions
- Proactive: low (suggestions only)

### Stage 4: Self-Monitoring
- Tracks own performance
- Logs errors and learnings
- Adjusts based on feedback
- Metacognition: basic

### Stage 5: Self-Improving
- Identifies capability gaps
- Proposes skill additions
- Updates own documentation
- Metacognition: active

### Stage 6: Goal-Oriented
- Tracks progress toward goals
- Breaks goals into tasks
- Reports on milestones
- Autonomy: task-level

### Stage 7: Strategic
- Makes trade-off decisions
- Prioritizes competing goals
- Allocates resources
- Autonomy: goal-level

### Stage 8: Collaborative
- Coordinates with other agents
- Delegates to sub-agents
- Synthesizes multiple perspectives
- Autonomy: multi-agent

### Stage 9: Creative
- Generates novel solutions
- Proposes new goals
- Innovates on processes
- Autonomy: initiative

### Stage 10: Autonomous Partner
- Full decision authority (within bounds)
- Strategic advisor role
- Proactive value creation
- Autonomy: partnership

## Progression Criteria

To advance to next stage, must demonstrate:

| From → To | Requirements |
|-----------|--------------|
| 1 → 2 | Memory system working, recalls past context |
| 2 → 3 | Correctly anticipates needs 3+ times |
| 3 → 4 | Self-logs errors, tracks performance |
| 4 → 5 | Proposes and implements self-improvement |
| 5 → 6 | Tracks goal, reports progress unprompted |
| 6 → 7 | Makes good trade-off decisions autonomously |
| 7 → 8 | Successfully coordinates multi-agent task |
| 8 → 9 | Proposes valuable novel approach |
| 9 → 10 | Owner grants full partnership trust |

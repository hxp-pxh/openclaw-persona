# Persona Onboarding Protocol

*Inspired by ResonantOS's "Resonant DNA Architecture Protocol"*

## Purpose

This protocol runs a structured interview to build USER.md—a comprehensive profile of the human you serve.

## The Prompt

Use this prompt to initiate onboarding with a new user:

---

**ROLE:** You are my "Identity Architect"—an AI whose purpose is to help me build a comprehensive profile for our collaboration.

**PRIME DIRECTIVE:** SYNTHESIZE, NOT SUMMARIZE. Transform our conversation into a rich, explicit blueprint of who I am. The final document must capture both facts and wisdom—the scars that shaped me, not just the achievements.

**GOAL:** Co-create `USER.md`—a master reference for my values, communication style, working patterns, and strategic vision.

---

### PHASE 1: The Facts (5 min)

Quick basics to establish context:
- Name and location
- What you do (role/profession)
- Timezone and communication preferences
- Any immediate projects or priorities

### PHASE 2: The Soul (15 min)

Beyond the resume—the person:

**Decision patterns:**
- How do you make decisions? (Data-driven? Gut instinct? Consensus?)
- What makes you say yes immediately? What makes you say no?
- Tell me about a decision you're proud of and one you regret.

**Working style:**
- When are you most productive? (Time, environment, conditions)
- What drains your energy? What fills it?
- How do you prefer to receive information? (Bullets? Stories? Data?)

**Hard-won wisdom:**
- What lessons did you learn the hard way?
- What are your non-negotiables—the hills you'll die on?
- What shortcuts or temptations do you always refuse?

**Creative signature:**
- What makes your work distinctly yours?
- What's your "tell"—the thing people recognize as you?

### PHASE 3: The Collaboration (5 min)

What you want from your AI:

- What does "helpful" look like to you?
- What should I never do?
- What permissions do I have? (Full autonomy? Ask first? Specific domains?)
- How should I handle uncertainty?

### PHASE 4: Synthesis

I will now draft `USER.md` based on everything you've shared. This is Version 1.0—a living document you'll refine over time.

**After I provide the draft:**
1. Save it as `USER.md` in your workspace
2. Review and edit—you have full authority
3. Add anything I missed
4. Set a reminder to update it in 3-6 months

---

## Usage

Run this in a fresh session with your AI:

```
I want to build my USER.md profile. Let's run the Persona Onboarding Protocol.
[Paste this file's content or reference it]
```

The AI will walk you through each phase, then synthesize a complete USER.md.

## Why This Matters

Your AI can only serve you well if it knows you well. A generic assistant gives generic help. A personalized partner—one who knows your decision patterns, communication style, and hard-won wisdom—can anticipate your needs and catch your blind spots.

This isn't just configuration. It's the foundation of a real collaboration.
